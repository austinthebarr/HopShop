# HopShop

A Web App, created with React, that I previously made with Angular to compare and contrast.
* Differences: React is very free which created more time of thinking how the project should be structured. Angular provided that structure so I could spend more time actually building out the application.

### Notes
Planning this project was very time consuming. I was happy I only had one stateful component. I am still getting used to React and believe I just need a good chunk of time to really understand best practices of structuring a React app.
